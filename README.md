This code is a complement to the Master's Thesis "Classification of Prognosis in Breast Cancer Patients using AMLC Analysis and Machine Learning Techiques" written at the department of Mathematical Statistics at Lund University, Sweden. The thesis is available via the home page of LUP student papers (https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search) and it is recommended that it is read before delving into the code. 

The code is written and tested using Matlab 2017a.
